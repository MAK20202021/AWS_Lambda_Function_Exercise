# AWS_Lambda_Function_Exercise

This exercise gives the idea how to create lambda function in AWS. It is serverless, it is ideal for small tasks that are frequently repeated. It can execute code without the maintainance of standard libraries. One code can work in one person's computer and sometimes it can not work in other's computer, lambda function can solve this problem.

## Project Motivation
This exercise provides the details procedure how to do preprocessing data through lambda function. It attached the IAM role to work with Amazon s3 service to take preloaded data from s3 bucket. It preprocessed data and stored data to the dedicated location of s3 bucket. 

## Acknowledgement
This exercise is for Udacity Nanodegree Program (https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). Thanks to Udacity for arranging this exercise to strengthen our knowledge. This exercise platform has been taken from Udacity.
## Installation
This exercise needs AWS account, AWS lambda service, AWS s3 service.

## File Description
The source codes are as follows:
- hello_preprocess.py
- lambda_Function.py

## Discussion
After completing this exercise, I understand how we can do preprocessing data through lambda function.
